Reduce->
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Definition: The reduce method in Java 8 is used with the Stream API to combine elements in a stream into a single result.
Parameters: It takes an initial (identity) value and a binary operator (function) as parameters.
Use Cases: It can be used to perform various types of reductions, such as summing elements, finding the maximum/minimum value, or custom operations like string concatenation.
Example: stream.reduce(identity, binaryOperator)
Benefits: Provides a more declarative way to process data without explicit loops.


*) mapToInt->

What is mapToInt?
In Java 8, mapToInt is like a magic wand for numbers in streams.
How does it work?
It turns things in a stream into numbers (specifically, into an IntStream).
Why is it useful?
You can use it to find sums, averages, or perform other math operations on your data.
Example:
If you have a bunch of ages in a stream, mapToInt can help you add them up easily.
Customization:
You can handle defaults or transform different objects into numbers as needed.
